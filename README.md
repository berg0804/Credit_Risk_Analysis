# Credit Risk Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this project is to train and evaluate models that will be used to ddetermine if loans are good or risky in the conext of a lendee's credit status. To evaluate the models, imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries will be used. The dataset used is from LendingClub and multiple algorithms will be utilized.
### Results
- Naive Random Oversampling

  - Balanced accuracy: 0.6234041499089175
  - High risk loans: Precision = 0.01, Recall = 0.63
  - Low risk loans: Precision = 1.00, Recall = 0.62
